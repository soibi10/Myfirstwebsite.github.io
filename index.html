    	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
    	<p>Netflix, Inc. is an American media-services provider headquartered in Los Gatos, California, founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. 
		The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming OTT service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including those produced in-house.[9] As of January 2019, Netflix had over 139 million paid subscriptions worldwide, 
		including 60.55 million in the United States, and over 148 million subscriptions total including free trials.[8][10] It is available almost worldwide except in mainland China (due to local restrictions) as well as Syria, North Korea, Iran, and Crimea (due to US sanctions). 
		The company also has offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.[11] Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).</p>
		
		<h2>HISTORY</h2>
		<p>On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[123]
        In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.
        On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[125] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. 
		The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[126] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change.
        In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.
        In January 2018, Netflix named Spencer Neumann as the new CFO.</P>
